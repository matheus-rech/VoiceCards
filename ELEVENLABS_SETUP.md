## üé® Advanced Customization

- **History Tutor**: Storytelling approach

### Custom Voices
1. Clone your own voice (Pro feature)
2. Use different voices for different languages
3. Create character-based tutors (child-friendly, professional, etc.)

### Webhook Enhancements
Add to `api/elevenlabs.js`:
```javascript
// Track streaks
if (difficulty === 'easy' || difficulty === 'good') {
  session.streak++;
  if (session.streak % 5 === 0) {
    return "Great streak! You're on fire!";
  }
}

// Adaptive encouragement
if (session.accuracy < 50) {
  return "You're doing great! Remember, learning takes time.";
}
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Session Tracking
Your webhook automatically tracks:
- Cards reviewed
- Accuracy percentage
- Session duration
- Difficulty distribution

### View Stats
```javascript
// Add to your webhook
console.log('Session Stats:', {
  user: session.userId,
  cards: session.stats.cardsReviewed,
  accuracy: session.stats.accuracy,
  duration: Date.now() - session.startedAt
});
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

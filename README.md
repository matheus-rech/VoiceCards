# 🎓 Voice-Controlled Flashcard Platform

**Study anywhere, anytime, hands-free.** The first truly voice-native spaced repetition learning platform built on the Model Context Protocol.

```
🗣️ "Alexa, start studying"
🤖 "Here's your first question: What is photosynthesis?"
🗣️ "Reveal"
🤖 "The answer is: The process by which plants convert light into energy"
🗣️ "Easy"
🤖 "Excellent! You'll see this again in 10 days..."
```

## ✨ What Makes This Different

**Existing solutions** (Anki, Quizlet):
- ❌ Require hands and eyes
- ❌ Clunky voice commands ("Alexa, tell Anki to...")
- ❌ No natural AI conversation
- ❌ Limited platform integration

**Your platform**:
- ✅ True hands-free with natural language
- ✅ Study while driving, cooking, or exercising
- ✅ MCP-powered (works with ANY compatible AI)
- ✅ Proven SM-2 spaced repetition
- ✅ Multi-platform from day one

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Have a working platform in 30 minutes:**

1. **Set up database** → [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md)
2. **Build MCP server** → You're in the right place!
3. **Choose a client** → [Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md)

```bash
# Get started now
cd /tmp/flashcard-mcp
npm install
npm run build
npm start

# ✅ Server running!
```

## 🎨 What You're Building

### Current State (Anki/Quizlet)
```
User opens app → Finds deck → Clicks card → 
Reads question → Thinks → Clicks reveal → 
Reads answer → Clicks difficulty → Repeat
```
❌ Requires full attention
❌ Can't multitask
❌ Interrupts workflow

### Your Platform
```
User says "start studying" → AI reads question → 
User thinks while doing other things → 
User says "reveal" → AI reads answer →
User says difficulty → AI continues
```
✅ Completely hands-free
✅ Study during dead time
✅ Natural conversation
